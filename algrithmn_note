28 Segment tree size

The expression 2 << (32 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(n - 1)) calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n. This is a common technique used in computer science for various purposes, such as determining the capacity for hash tables or memory allocation. 
Here's a breakdown of how it works: 

• n - 1: Subtracting 1 from n ensures that if n is already a power of 2, the result of Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(n - 1) will correctly lead to n itself as the output. 
• Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(n - 1): This Java method returns the count of zero bits preceding the highest-order ("leftmost") one-bit in the two's complement binary representation of (n - 1). For example, if n - 1 is 7 (binary 0...0111), numberOfLeadingZeros would return 29 (assuming a 32-bit integer). [1]  
• 32 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(n - 1): This calculation determines the position of the most significant bit (MSB) of (n - 1). Specifically, it gives the number of bits required to represent (n - 1), effectively ceil(log2(n)). Using the previous example where n - 1 is 7, 32 - 29 = 3. 
• 2 &lt;&lt; (result of step 3): This performs a left bit shift operation. It shifts the binary representation of 2 (which is 0...010) to the left by the number of positions calculated in the previous step. This effectively calculates 2 raised to the power of that number, resulting in the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n. For example, 2 &lt;&lt; 3 would be 16. 

In essence, this expression efficiently finds the next power of two for a given integer n.

35 String hashing time complexity
	The time complexity of hashing a String in Java is generally O(n), where 'n' is the length of the string.

	While the initial calculation of the hash code is O(n), Java's String class caches this value. Subsequent calls to hashCode() on the same String instance will return the cached value in O(1) time, as long as the string content has not changed.

	Therefore, for the first time a string's hash code is computed, the complexity is O(n). For all subsequent computations of the same string's hash code, the complexity becomes O(1) due to caching.
